This is a simple image uploader app for Android.

It's meant to work with https://github.com/andrew-d/imagehost

It is a work in progress! Feel free to report bugs or send pull requests.

Note that the earliest supported version of Android is 4.1 (Jellybean). It could probably support earlier versions with the support library, but that has not yet been done.

As for building it, it should just load into a properly-configured Eclipse and build as long as you have an Android SDK for 4.1 or later.
